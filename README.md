# d3phantomjs
D3 SVG generation together with phantomjs

This is only a test implementation but we want to work on a working solution for our project. 

Issue: when running Phantomjs I always encounter an incomplete SVG code and it doesn't display the full SVG element. But when display the innerHTML in the browser console is displays the full SVG code.
